# Task: Optimize on async functions

## Description

Rewrite the - getAllImpressions method to get better performance and explain the mechanics behind the solution. Approach the task as you would approach real life project, code base changes and refactors are allowed. But do not change the timeout variable.
When the script execution is finished, the function should return the amount of fetched imopressions together with the time it took to fetch them.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
